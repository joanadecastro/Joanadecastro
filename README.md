# Hello, Iâ€™m Joana, welcome to my github page ðŸ‘‹

 
 I'm a designer and last year I decided to change my career and get to know the code world. At the moment, I'm passionate about code and design.
 I'm curious about the web and currently honing my skills and learning every day to become a better developer and person.
 I spend most of the time developing my first project that started in the flag front-end course and it Â´s focused on html, css, javascript and in the future react.
 I love sharing, learning and experimenting with codes.
 I love challenges and problem solving, my main goal is to learn and create amazing and functional apps in a work environment that makes an impact!
